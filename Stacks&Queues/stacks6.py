#Suppose you have three nonempty stacks R, S and T. 
#Describe a sequence of operations that results in S storing all 
#elements originally in T below of Sâ€™s original elements, 
#with both sets of those elements in their original configuration. 
#For example, if R = [1,2,3], S = [4, 5] and T = [6, 7, 8, 9], 
#the final configuration should have R = [1, 2, 3] and S = [6, 7, 8,  9, 4, 5].
